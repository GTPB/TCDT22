Training Course Delivery Tech

This content is aimed at newcomers to training course delivery

Training course design is deliberately not explored here in any detail here

### General thoughts about learning activities

Transfer of knowledge and skills

Formal, Non-formal and Informal Learning

### Contact with the subject matter

Reduction of lecture times

Flipped-classroom technique

Adult learner specificities

### Training

Training = delivery of skills + self confidence

The role of discussions and exercises

Feedback and assessment

### When and where does learning take place?

Active learning

Not a single learning theory can be universally accepted

Constructivism (Piaget)

Connectivism, not really a learning theory

Teaching and training adults

Use of collective intelligence techniques:

### Actual delivery
Starting a training course

Break the ice and establish a teamwork (group) attitude

Induce self-introspection as a formative assessment method

Induce the methods of instant feedback

Open display of results as a method of learning reinforcement

Engagement

The role of wrap-up sessions

- Carefully read the strategies 
- Pick one strategy you like 
- Discuss how you would implement it as an instructorhe 
- Discuss the costs and benefits

## 7 evidence-based learning principles
#### Principle P1:
Learners' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.
#### Principle P2:
How learners organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.
#### Principle P3:
Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn.
#### Principle P4:
To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and
know when to apply what they have learned.
#### Principle P5:
Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of learning.
#### Principle P6:
Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual
climate of the course to impact learning.
#### Principle P7:
To become self-directed, they must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches
to learning.

## Challenge: How do you understand the seven principles of learning? (10 min)
- Work in groups of three.
- Carefully read the strategies as a group.
- Pick one principle that is not clear to you.
- Ask one question.

## Challenge: Teaching versus training
- Based on your experience, what are in your opinion the differences between teaching and
training?
- Identify some main differences
- Discuss them in the group

## Bloom's taxonomy
---
### Bloom's six categories of cognitive skills
![](https://i.imgur.com/M4xZHFQ.png)
---
### Using Bloom's taxonomy
- Bloom's taxonomy can be helpful in aligning the training with the learners' level of
thinking (complexity, experience, etc).
- In practice, Bloom's level of cognitive complexity can be used to:
- Write learning outcomes (LOs)
- Design instruction and learning experiences
- Assess learning

### Each learning instance needs to have clearly defined LEARNING OUTCOME
### A learning instance should fit in one, maximum two levels
### Subsequent learning instances should not jump over a level
### Assessments of whichever form should target the instance level, not above, not below

---
## Learning outcomes (LOs)
- LOs (more accurately “desired LOs”) are statements of what you might (in principle) assess.
- You may not end up assessing all of them, but they are statements of what a successful*
learner will know or be able to AUTONOMOUSLY do at the end of instruction.
- By the end of the course (session/course/instruction) the successful learner will be able
to AUTONOMOULY .......

---
### Writing learning outcomes using assessable verbs

1. Think about what learners will be able to do by the end of instruction
2. Use the sentence:
- By the end of the lesson (session/course/instruction) the successful learner will be
able to.........
3. Replace dots with a verb that you can assess (name, explain, solve, distinguish, etc.).
4. Avoid verbs that are open to many interpretations: e.g., appreciate, have faith in, know,
learn, understand, believe

---
## How do I write LOs?
1. Think of a lesson/session you usually deliver
2. Write one or more Learning Outcomes for the lesson/session
3. Write the title of the lesson/session and the corresponding LO(s)
4. Discuss in the group

## What can we do to make more room in working memory?
- Chunking
- Increase background knowledge
- Avoid extraneous cognitive load

## Increasing background knowledge

Principle **P1**: Learners' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.

## Mental models
Mental model - A collection of concepts and facts, along with the relationships between those
concepts, that a person has about a topic or field.

---
## Novice vs Competent Practitioner vs Expert
- A novice, typically has not yet built a mental model of the field.
- A competent practitioner has a mental model that works for many purposes, but will not be
very accurate.
- Experts’ mental models are much more densely connected. Therefore they can jump directly
from a problem to its solution because there is a direct link between the two in their mind.

- Help novices build a mental model
- Help learners make connections
- Detect and remedy misconceptions
- Be aware of the limitations of expertise
- Expert blind spot
- Fluid representations
---
## Three classes of misconceptions
1. **Simple factual errors**: These are the easiest to correct.
2. **Broken models**: We can address these by having learners reason through examples to see
contradictions.
3. **Fundamental beliefs**: These beliefs are deeply connected to the learner’s social
identity and are the hardest to change.

---
## Cognitive load
1. **Intrinsic cognitive load** is the effort associated with a specific topic.
2. **Germane cognitive load** it is the (desirable) mental effort required to create linkages
between new information and old.
2. **Extraneous cognitive load** is everything else that distracts or gets in the way.
Extraneous cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner.

## Attention split effect
![](https://i.imgur.com/GvMRzj7.png)
Split-attention occurs when learners are required to split their attention between at least
two sources of information that have been separated either spatially or temporally.


---
## Other factors facilitating memory and learning (Willingham, 2009)
1. Things that create an emotional reaction will be better remembered, but emotion is not
necessary for learning (and it is definitely not sufficient!).
2. If you don't pay attention to something, you can't learn it.
3. Repetition helps but repetition alone is not sufficient.
4. Wanting to remember something has little or no effect.
5. Thinking about meaning is good for memory.
6. Practice makes learning long lasting.
7. Spaced practice is of great benefit for memory.
